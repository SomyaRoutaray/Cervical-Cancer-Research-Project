## 🏥 Background
Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women globally.  
This study was conducted at the **Acharya Harihar Post Graduate Institute of Cancer**, with a goal to:
- Understand the role of **microvascular density (MVD)** in tumor growth.  
- Correlate MVD with various **clinical stages of cervical cancer**.  
- Provide data-driven insights for **oncology treatment strategies**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)** – For CD34 marker analysis  
- **Microscopy Techniques** – Tissue examination and analysis  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data tabulation and statistical analysis  
- **Scientific Research Methodology** – Experimental design and result interpretation

## 🔍 Research Process

### **Step 1: Sample Collection**
- Collected cervical tissue samples from patients across different cancer stages.  
- Maintained strict **ethical and regulatory compliance** during collection.

### **Step 2: Laboratory Analysis**
- Applied **CD34 markers** to highlight microvascular structures.  
- Prepared and stained slides using **IHC protocols**.

### **Step 3: Data Measurement**
- Counted **microvascular structures** under high-power microscopy.  
- Recorded measurements systematically in Excel for analysis.

### **Step 4: Statistical Analysis**
- Used descriptive and inferential statistics to determine correlations between:
  - MVD and cancer stage  
  - MVD and patient outcomes

## 📊 Key Findings
| **Parameter**       | **Observation** |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Early-Stage Cancer  | Moderate angiogenesis |
| Mid-Stage Cancer    | Significant increase in angiogenesis |
| Advanced-Stage Cancer | Very high MVD correlating with aggressive tumor growth |

> **Conclusion:** Higher **microvascular density** indicates aggressive tumor behavior and can be used as a **predictive marker** for staging.
